The Approximate Number Sense (ANS) test tests the users ability to distinguish which side of an image has a higher number of dots.

To run the test, run the run_ans.ipynb file. 
To view the code, open the ans_test_code.ipynb v2 file.

Improvements to ans_test_code.ipynb made in v2:
- added docstrings and comments
- added run_ans.ipynb which allows the user to take the test without having to see any of the code
- the user is shown their ranking and result at the end of the test
- the user is able to see which question they are on and so how far through the test they are
