# Memory Test

This is the memory test. 8 grids are displayed for 10 seconds, and for each grid, a series of questions will be asked. 

## Improvements made to v1.0
- Test gives user feedback about the accuracy of their answer after each question. 
- Images are made bigger and clearer for easier user-interface. 
- Shapes are labelled with their name to make it friendly for non-english speakers.
