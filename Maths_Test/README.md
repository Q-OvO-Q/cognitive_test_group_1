# Math Ability Test
The test will last for 3 minutes with 1 minute for each section.
The difficulty of questions will be different in each section, from easy to hard.
You will need to perform a sequence of calculations and provide the answer.
Each part of the calculation is only shown for a short period of time and then hidden.
Perform calculations SEQUENTIALLY rather than following standard arithmetic precedence rules.
There is no upper limit for the score. The more correct ones, the higher the score.
DO NOT USE CALCULATORS FOR HELP.
